# Project 25-007 Trefimet

## Project Structure

This repository contains two main directories:

### Python Implementation (`Python_25-007/`)
The Python folder is dedicated to:
- Sensor testing and validation
- Configuration file generation (JSON format) for sensors
- Real-time monitoring and data acquisition
- Data logging and storage in Excel format
- Test execution and result visualization
- Experiment data collection and analysis

### C Implementation (`C_25-007/`)
The C folder is specifically for:
- VigiaBox NEO RTU programming
- Control logic implementation
- Telemetry system development
- RTU firmware development
- Hardware-specific implementations

## Purpose

This dual-language approach serves different aspects of the project:
- **Python**: Handles testing, configuration, and data analysis
- **C**: Manages the core functionality of the VigiaBox NEO RTU

## Getting Started

1. For sensor testing and configuration:
   - Navigate to `Python_25-007/`
   - Follow the Python README for setup instructions

2. For VigiaBox NEO RTU development:
   - Navigate to `C_25-007/`
   - Follow the C README for development guidelines

## Project Status

- [ ] Python sensor testing framework
- [ ] JSON configuration system
